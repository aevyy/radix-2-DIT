## Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) Implementation

This is a short & basic DFT implementation for personal experimentation and learning. It serves as a foundation for a future implementation of the radix-2 DIT FFT algorithm.

Currently, it uses a most basic and straightforward approach and precomputes the full twiddle factor table. Performance is not a concern at this stage.
